# Determining a micro-location of a mobile device
> Diploma thesis, Ivan KraljeviÄ‡

## Abstract

Positioning technologies that receive signals from distant satellites (such as GPS) are not suitable indoors. 
Because of that, the indoor navigation and positioning problem requires a new and different approach.
With the adoption of the Bluetooth 4.0 specification and the Bluetooth Low Energy technology, a large number of cheap Bluetooth Smart Ready devices that could be used for solving the indoor positioning problem has been manufactured. 
The radio signal that propagates in a indoor environment is affected by a large number of factors and because of that, using BLE technology for precise indoor positioning isn't appropriate.
Despite of that, it can be used in almost all situations where the content changes depending on the context of the environment so today BLE is being increasingly integrated into mobile applications.
